**What should be the ideal camera configuration?**

A 2MP camera is generally sufficient for most AI-based applications. However, higher resolutions can improve detection accuracy and detail.

**What camera configurations are suitable for AI?**

Any camera with a resolution above 2MP is recommended for AI solutions, as it provides the clarity and data needed for accurate analysis.

**What is the minimum required internet bandwidth?**

A minimum of 10Mbps upload speed is needed to handle 5 cameras. For each additional camera, add 0.35Mbps. The download speed should consistently be 10Mbps or higher for optimal performance.

**What is the standard lead time for GPU orders?**

The typical lead time for GPU delivery is 2 weeks from the date of the purchase order (PO).

**How do you connect a GPU with an NVR/DVR or cameras?**

Both the GPU and NVR/DVR need to be on the same local network, typically bridged via a network switch.

**Can cameras be directly accessed through an NVR or DVR?**

Yes, cameras can be accessed through an NVR/DVR, but a network switch is required to connect the GPU and the NVR/DVR.

**Can an IP camera be directly connected to the GPU?**

Yes, IP cameras can be connected directly to the GPU, but a network switch is needed for the connection.

**What types of deployments does Assert AI offer?**

Assert AI provides both cloud-based and edge-based AI deployment options.

**What security certifications does Assert AI hold?**

Assert AI is certified for VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing), ISMS 27001, and SOC2 compliance.

**What is the effective range of your AI solution?**

Our AI solution is effective up to 75% of the cameraâ€™s focal distance.

**What types of cameras does your solution support?**

We support a variety of camera types, including dome, bullet, unifocal, bifocal, and PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras.

**What are the camera bandwidth requirements?**

A bandwidth of 4Mbps is required to access a single camera when using multi-stream mode.

**Can all devices be connected wirelessly?**

While wireless connections are possible, we recommend wired connections due to enhanced security and better performance. Wireless connections may pose security risks and lead to reduced performance.
