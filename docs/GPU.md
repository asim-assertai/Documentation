### **OS Transfer**

When flashing the Jetson SOM (System on Module), the operating system is initially installed on the eMMC. If you need to transfer the OS to an SSD or SD card, follow these steps

**Format the SSD or sd card**

```
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme0n1
sudo fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p1
```

**Download and Extract Required Files**

[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16R8RoCx-6oYDGRgITnLtxrTqIMEmVE_h/view?usp=sharing) the provided ZIP file. After extracting it, you will find two important shell scripts:

 - ```copy-rootfs-ssd.sh```
 - ```setup-service.sh```

**Run the Scripts**

 - Run the copy-rootfs-ssd.sh script to copy the root filesystem to the SSD or SD card.

 - After that, run the setup-service.sh script to configure the necessary services for booting from the SSD or SD card.

**Reboot Device**

Once the scripts have been executed successfully, restart the system.

**Verify the Transfer**

After rebooting, run the following command to check if the operating system is now running from the SSD or SD card:

```
df -h
```
